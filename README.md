My current idea is to access a Steam Profile, copy some basic information like the
title and the header image of a game and also persist the overall gametime and
recent playtime based on a Steam UserID. The Homepage then will show the top
overall games and the recently played games.

Within the admin panel you can see some overall game stats like total achievements as well as
your daily playtime in a calendar with colored squares according to the playtime of the day 
(from light green to dark red), all games played in the month and some statistics about average
playtime per month, overall playtime per month and a payment overview.

All these information are accumulated over all games but most can also be checked by game to
get a better understanding of gaming habits.
