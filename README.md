# Gamer-Profile - a way to share your game experience

[Demo Page](https://satannorris.de)

Gaming can be a lot of fun and thanks to YouTube and Twitch you can share your
sessions as live stream or VOD. But what about writing small blog posts or sharing
game stats? Some services like Steam allow reading public stats like the time played
or the achievements earned in a game. But having a blog about the games isn't 
possible on steam.

My current idea is to access a Steam Profile, copy some basic information like the
title and the header image of a game and also persist the overall gametime and
recent playtime based on a Steam UserID. The Homepage then will show the top
Overall Games and the recently played games and if created the last posts.

Later on the project should be able to show more statistics, have a page per game with
some more information and a full list of posts. Thereafter I want to implement 
other game services like Battle.net, uPlay or GoG - or if not possible have the
option to create and update games in a backend.
